# 🧪 Mutant Testing Reborn Hub V1

> A full-access admin-style hub for the discontinued **Mutant Testing Reborn** experience.

---

## 📖 Overview

**Mutant Testing Reborn Hub V1** is an advanced admin-style script designed for the discontinued *Mutant Testing Reborn* game on :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
Because the game is no longer actively maintained, many features, units, and gameplay systems became **locked, removed, or inaccessible**—especially those tied to:

- Gamepasses  
- Robux purchases  
- Badge unlock requirements  
- Admin-only testing content  
- Hidden developer menus  

This hub restores access to those systems, allowing you to explore the **full original content** of the game without the limitations that existed when the game was still monetized.

---

## ⚙️ What This Hub Does

Mutant Testing Reborn Hub V1 acts as a **complete spawning and control panel**, giving access to content that was previously:

- Paywalled behind Robux  
- Locked behind rare badges  
- Admin-only or developer test units  
- Hidden in internal menus (UltimateMenu)  
- Removed or no longer obtainable

The script includes a modern **Rayfield UI** layout with categorized tabs and global settings for easy use.
